# ü§î Why Assembly?
- Why would anyone learn that language, which is hard to learn, write, debug & maintain.

- Why would anyone learn that language, which is different for different hardware & architecture.
- Why would anyone learn that language, which is not used in any modern programming language, operating system, compiler.

Great! You are reading this means that you are:
1.	Student being forced to learn assembly.

1.	Student who wants to learn assembly for [fun](https://youtu.be/9bZkp7q19f0?t=9).
1.	You are just exploring this stuff. 
1.	You have interest in learning assembly. 
1.	You want to become [hacker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture), [cracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cracker_(computing)), [computer scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist), [computer engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_engineer), [computer architect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architect), [computer technician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_technician).
### Drawbacks of Assembly:
1.	Assembly is hard to learn, read, understand, write, maintain, debug and explain to others.

1.	It is different for different hardware & [architecture](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Assembly_language#Architecture). 
1.	For speed & efficiency, we use better algorithms & improved [compiler technology](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2015/february/compilers-what-every-programmer-should-know-about-compiler-optimizations). 
### Benefits of Assembly:
But on the other side, assembly language gives you more speed, space, capability and knowledge of your hardware. That the reason why [GOAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_of_All_Time) programmer [Chris Sawyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Sawyer) able to run such resource intensive game [RollerCoaster Tycoon](http://www.chrissawyergames.com/feature5.htm) on an [old processors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium). So, the benefits are:

1.	You will understand how computers work.

1.	You wlll understand how [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system), [CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit), [memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_(computing)), [cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)), [register](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_register), [instruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set) works.
1.	You will understand the [computer architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture).
1.	You want to write efficient code.
1.	You want complete control of your computer.
1.	You love binary (you are not [human](http://www.captcha.net/images/recaptcha-example.gif)).

1. [8088](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8088) Assembler and Simulator is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16rATc7y1x0Xw1V6MEip7waSMP316dxmy/view?usp=sharing).

1. Otherwise, If you have `git` installed, then you can clone the repository using the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MahadMuhammad/Learn-Assembly-The-Hard-Way.git
    ```
1. Or, you can download the zip file from the GitHub repository main page.
1. Extract the zip file.
1. Open the extracted folder.
1. Open the `folder`.
1. Open the `8088 Assembler and Simulator` folder.
1. Now, you can use the [8088](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8088) Assembler and Simulator `DOSBOX`.

# üí≠ Logic Building and Problem Solving with Assembly Language:
### Common Mistakes:
- Many people start writing code without thinking about the logic.

- They just start writing code.
- My **advice** is that you should first think about the logic on **paper**, make an **algorithm** and then start writing code. 
### Logic Building:
- If you are completely **stuck** on a problem and didn't think about the logic, then first write the code in the high level language like `Python` or `C/C++` and then convert it into assembly language.

- If you are unable to convert that `high level langauge` code into `assembly language` code, then use the [compiler explorer](https://godbolt.org/z/6oaTnh8nz) to convert it into assembly language code.
### Resolving Errors:
- If you get an unkown error, then first try to understand that error.
- Use assembly language debugger to debug your code.

- Debug your code `line by line`.
- If this doesn't work, then try taking help from your friends, seniors, teachers, etc. 
- Also if you are good at this then try helping your friends, juniors in solving their problems.
